# SimpleChattyBot
### Backend for a simple Tic Tac Toe game, made as a part of the Jetbrains beginnner course.
#### Description:
The program displays an empty 3x3 table and prompts the user to enter coordinates for his move.
Then the status of the game is checked and if there is no winner, the next player is prompted to enter coordinates for his move. The process repeats, until there is a winner or a draw.
